# Test-Driven Development for Data Analytics Application

A collection of helpful tips for integrating test-driven development to your data analysis workflow.

# Objective 🎯
- To collect the knowledge and tips I got along the way of integrating the testing module to my data analytics workflow.

# Benefits 🏆
1. Test case will help you capture the mistake you may introduce without knowing it. When you change some codes in your analysis, it may affect the other parts. So you would want to know it beforehand and fix it as soon as possible.
2. Test case helps me understand how the code is doing when I introduce a new change and what I should be aware of in my end-to-end data analysis. 
3. When you transfer your code to others for further development, it helps others to check the result and ensure that the whole path is still working together as it should be.

# Table of contents 📚
1. Create mock-up data in pandas, pyspark, and pandas on spark.
2. Structure a configuration file and test cases folder.
3. Speed up test cases for the pyspark application.
4. Compare your actual data frame with the expected data frame.
